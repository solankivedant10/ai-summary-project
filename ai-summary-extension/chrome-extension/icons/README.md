# Extension Icons

This directory should contain icon files for the Chrome extension.

## Required Icons

The extension needs the following icon files:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels) 
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Creating Icons

You can create simple icons using:
1. Online icon generators
2. Image editing software
3. AI image generation tools

## Example Icon Creation

For a quick start, you can create simple colored squares or use text-based icons.

## Icon Guidelines

- Use PNG format
- Keep file sizes small
- Ensure good visibility at small sizes
- Use consistent design across all sizes

## Temporary Solution

Until you add custom icons, you can:
1. Use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images
2. Rename them to match the required filenames
3. Place them in this directory

The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience.
